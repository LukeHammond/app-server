"a pattern that devs can follow to segment all api behavior and requirements into a standalone application"

== App Server 

The purpose of this project it to examine different patterns that can be used to iteratively port functionality from a legacy app into this engine.

We know up front that we will need to extend the code we relocate to the engine. In other words we will be distilling out core functionality within the engine, and then mixing in custom logic in the legacy host app.
